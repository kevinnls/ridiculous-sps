# Ridiculous Stone-Paper-Scissors

### thanks to a ridiculous PvP implementation

uhm... yea i don't know what else to say.

the plan is to use Firestore and create a collection that 2 people "share"
to play stone paper scissors

each game session is a collection which is accessed by a randomly generated ID

> "crazy expensive and horrible"

yes, that's why i called it ridiculous.
